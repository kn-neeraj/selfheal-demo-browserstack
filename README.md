Browserstack Self Heal Demo Scripts

## Purpose
This repository is a central place to host all BrowserStack Self-Heal demo scripts for various frameworks and products. Instead of maintaining multiple separate repos, we keep all self-heal related demos here, organized by branch. This makes it easy to find, update, and compare self-heal demos across different technologies.

## How to Use
- **Explore Self-Heal Demos:**
  - Each branch in this repository contains a self-heal demo for a specific framework or product (e.g., TestNG, JUnit, Playwright, Cypress, etc.).
  - Switch to the branch that matches the framework or product you want to test.
- **Run the Demo:**
  - Follow the README and instructions in that branch to set up and run the self-heal demo for your chosen stack.
  - Most demos include scripts and configuration to show how BrowserStack's self-heal feature can recover from locator changes without modifying your test code.

## Why This Structure?
- **Single Source:** All self-heal demos are in one place for easy discovery and maintenance.
- **Branch-per-Framework:** Quickly switch between frameworks/products by changing branches.
- **Consistent Updates:** New self-heal demos for additional frameworks/products will be added as new branches.
